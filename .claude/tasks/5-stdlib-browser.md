## Problem to solve

In the website documentation, the list of string functions is unclear in my opinion
(and examples should not include assert calls).

Let's improve it, so that the user can browse the stdlib in a friendler way,
taking into account the fact that the stdlib will grow with other functions
for other types.

## Idea

Separate the language definition (syntax, constants, operators) from the stdlib,
somehow. So that the user can have a brief introduction, and a great reference.
