## Problem to solve

I have two concerns with the current website :

* There is no navigation menu on mobile. I would love having a menu allowing
  the user to easily reach a section of the language reference or stdlib.
* I don't really like the fact that the stdlib is below the language reference
  (in the page itself, I'm ok with the left menu). I would prefer the stdlib
  to have it's own page, with a better user exprerience regarding search
  (that should hide empty sections IMO).

How can we improve that ?

## Idea

* Keep the menu as such, but provide a mobile version
* Distinguish `Language reference` and `Standard library` in main tabs
* Improve UX of the stdlib by moving the input search higher the new dedicated
  page
