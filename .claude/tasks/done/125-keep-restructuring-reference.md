## Problem to solve

I'm still not happy with the Reference's table of contents. Let's improve it
once again.

## Idea

1. I think Tuple, List and Functions/Lambda should be moved to CORE chapter,
   in that order.
2. the DATA chapter should have
   - Data Selector (a reminder that Data(string) allows parsing json)
   - Input data
   - Data paths (+ fetch/patch)
   - Data schemas
   - Data formats

## Post implementation comments

- `Note: See Type Selectors for all available selectors ...`, good. Also add
  a note towards `Data schemas` then.
