## Problem to solve

It's a pity we have syntax highlighting on examples, but not in Try itself...

* Any chance we can use Codemirror or similar for the editor ?
* And highlight javascript/ruby/SQL code generated ?

## Idea

* Either we keep having our own highligher.js
* Or we try again with highlight.js or similar.
