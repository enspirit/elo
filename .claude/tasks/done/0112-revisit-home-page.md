## Problem to solve

I don't like the "Elo vs JavaScript" section on home page. Not compelling enough.

## Idea

- Let's forget about the comparison
- Move to "What makes Elo unique / different ?" (Claude: find the good title)
- Highlight :
  - Datetime/Duration are first-class + temporal arithmetics
  - Data schema + validation/coercion/dress
  - Functional + comprehensive standard library
  - Coming soon: relation algebra powered by Bmg
- In each case
  - either we remove the left/right comparison
  - or we show a compelling example on left, and short explanation/generalisation
    at right
