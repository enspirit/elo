## Problem to solve

Let's improve the home page of the website.

- We should find something nicer instead of `K, a portable expression language`.
  Short, concise, very clear, appealing.
- We should take arguments in README: simple, portable, safe, well-designed
- AI-Native Design should be the third argument, not the first
- We should insist on the simplicity of a data/functional language
  - no distinction between `==` and `eql` (value vs. reference)
  - no new
  - everything is a value
- We should discuss the target : providing a clean data expression language for
  No-Code.
- No need to talk about Enspirit's libraries on the home page

## Idea

Let's make an improvement pass.
