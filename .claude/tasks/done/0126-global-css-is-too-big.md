## Problem

The global.scss file is too big. And there are also too many style inconsistencies
on the website.

## Idea

Let's refactor that :

- Split the file in various sub-files
- Let's see how to extract a proper design system with general rules (colors, spacing, etc.)
  and reusable components.
- Clean existing CSS as much as possible to use the design system instead.
