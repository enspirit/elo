## Problem to solve

I think we can make a simple improvement of the Reference section, by removing
the "Type System" chapter, and move content elsewhere:

- "Type selectors" should come right after Literals, explaining that those
  literal are nothing but syntactic shortcuts over type selectors.

  Also we could put a sentence and link torwards the section on type definition
  (see next bullet)

- "Type definitions" could then be move to "Data schemas" in the DATA chapter.
