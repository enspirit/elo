## Problem to solve

I'd like to make the job of contributors easier.

* Remove ROADMAP.md, or rewrite it, it seems very outdated
* Create a CHANGELOG.md by inspecting history. Keep it short since we only
  created tags lately.
* Add a HACKING.md with instructions to hack on Elo on his own computer or
  using the .claude/safe-setup docker image. Refer to HACKING.md in README's
  contributing section.
