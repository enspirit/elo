## Problem to solve

The learner should be invited to complete exercice(s) to check their
understanding.

## Idea

- Complete the Learn page with various exercices
- The Learn sections would refer to exercices to complete
- A list of all exercices would be present in the main menu
- Each exercice would come with a short description of the computation to
  achieve. A base program would come with a few assertions that need to pass.
- It would be possible to ask for a solution, which would then appear.

Make a base proposal with one or two examples, we'll see from there.
