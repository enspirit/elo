## Problem to solve

K is a very bad name for our programming language, because it already exists.

## Idea

I'd like to rername it to Elo, provided it's available. Help me :

Check whether the following plan works (wild availability), and refactor
accordingly :

- Elo name
- .elo file extension
- `bin/eloc` for the compiler (`bin/elo` for the evaluator, eventually)
- elo-lang.org
- @enspirit/elo on npm
  $ elo on rubygems
