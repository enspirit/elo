## Problem to solve

If Elo if useful to others, I'd like them to know who we are and how to
support us. How to do that nicely ?

- Tell who I am, to be taken seriously
- Possible list related/previous work (see README), with same goal
- How to support us :
  - Hire the Enspirit.dev team
  - Use Klaro Cards and buy licence
  - Donate on github
- Tribute to Elodie : remember that Music is our best way to compete my life as a never-ending software engineer.

## Idea

- Directly on home page, super visible ?
- Or on an About page ?
- How to make people consider supporting this work ?
