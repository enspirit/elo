## Problem to solve

In Klaro Cards one canuse BOT (beginning or time) and EOT (end of time) in
time interval (e.g. `x in BOT ... TODAY`).

For backward compatibility, I would need something similar in Elo.

## Idea

- Use smallest and biggest datetime ?
- Use object markers and use them in all comparisons ?
- Special support in dayjs or luxon ?
