## Problem to solve

Code examples in blog posts are unreadable (colors are wrong).

It's not the first time, regression.

## Idea

- The examples on homepage are perfect in comparison.
- Check your recently introduced design system.
- Make sure we have only one way to highlight Elo code examples and always
  use the same in all pages of the website.
- Clean the CSS accordingly, if you then find outdated ways of handling code.
