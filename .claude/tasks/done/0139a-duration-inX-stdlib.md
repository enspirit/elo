# Duration inX stdlib

Look at @.claude/tasks/analyzed/0139-undressing-syntax.md.
We clearly decided there that `isDays` and similar functions would be put in
the stdlib (not special contructs).

## Idea

* Let's list those inX functions and define their semantics.
* Let's then implement them in the compiler
